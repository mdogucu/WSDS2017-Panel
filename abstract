While WSDS provides a much-needed platform to discuss the unique barriers women confront in the fields of statistics and data science, we question whether feminism, a belief in the sociopolitical and economic equality of women and men, could provide a useful theoretical context from which to frame this discussion. Or, if feminism is viewed as too singular and exclusive, would introducing intersectional feminism into the field of statistics and data science lead to more inclusion and opportunities for advancement of diverse individuals in the field who represent or are allies of women of color, immigrant groups, LGBTQIA+, or individuals with disabilities? Additionally, could intersectional feminism provide a constructive lens from which we can optimally scrutinize the lack of representation of diverse women in survey samples, clinical trials, etc.? The panelists will tackle these challenging questions and share their perspectives and varying opinions on whether or not they think there is room for intersectional feminism in the fields of statistics and data science.
